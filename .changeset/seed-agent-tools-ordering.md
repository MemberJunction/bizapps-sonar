Fix a fresh-install failure introduced by the agent tool-surface seed (#24): the `AIAgentAction` insert block was placed right after the agent/prompt seeding, but the `Sonar:` Action rows it references (via the enforced `ActionID` foreign key) aren't created until later in the same migration. On an already-populated dev DB the actions existed so it passed, but on a clean `mj app install` the block ran first and hit a FK violation, aborting the whole seed.

Moved the block to the end of the seed migration (after all agents and actions are created) with a placement-guard comment. Verified: a from-scratch FK-ordering repro fails in the old order and succeeds in the new order.
