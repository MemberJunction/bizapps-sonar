Sonar Authoring Agent reliability: validate authored factors (data source + aggregate field), clearer compiler error, higher iteration limits.

- **Factor authoring is validated against the real schema.** `Sonar: Build Model` and `Sonar: Create Factor` created declarative factors even when (1) no data source was resolved — yielding orphaned factors (`SourceRelatedEntityID = NULL`) — or (2) a column-referencing field (`aggregateFieldName` or `dateField`) wasn't a real column on the source entity (weak models hallucinate names like `TotalAmount` for a `TotalGross` column, or `duration_days` for a column that doesn't exist). Both cases only surfaced at compile/recompute time. Both actions now reject them up front with actionable errors (valid source aliases / valid columns), so the agent self-corrects in-run instead of shipping an uncompilable model. (FilterExpression is free-form SQL — left to the engine, not column-parsed.)
- **Prompt hint.** The agent's system prompt now tells it to take the exact `aggregateFieldName`/`dateField` from the columns `Sonar: List Related Entities` returns, never invent one — so it leans on the new column data deliberately. Delivered as a forward migration (SQL Server + PG) patching the seeded `TemplateContent`; the frozen seed is untouched.
- **Column visibility for the agent.** `Sonar: List Related Entities` now returns each candidate source's `columns` (name + type + a `numeric` flag), so the agent picks a real `aggregateFieldName` from the list instead of guessing one — attacking the hallucination at the source (proactive), where the validation above is the reactive backstop.
- **Clearer FactorCompiler error.** A model-owned factor with no source now reports "no data source — link it to a model related entity," instead of the misleading "library factors not supported yet" (which properly refers only to shared `ScoreModelID = NULL` factors).
- **Signal Studio signals are now bound to an anchor.** Custom (code-backed) signals were commissioned with only a text description — ActionSmith never knew which entity `AnchorRecordID` belonged to, so it guessed and authored code that `Load`ed the wrong entity by the wrong key (e.g. loading Member Profiles by a Person id → null for every record). The commission form now requires picking the anchor the signal scores, and the kickoff hands ActionSmith that anchor's schema (the anchor entity, its related sources, and each one's link field + columns) as Context. The factor brief spells out the contract: `AnchorRecordID` is the anchor entity's primary key; start from the anchor and reach related data by following its foreign keys, never by loading another entity by `AnchorRecordID`.
- **Higher agent run limits (12/18 → 36/64).** Real, MoreCheese-scale authoring legitimately exceeds 12 Loop iterations; runs were aborting at the cap mid-authoring (verified in AIAgentRun logs). Delivered as forward migrations (SQL Server + PG); the seed stays frozen.
