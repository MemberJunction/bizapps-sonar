Bring the 3 Overview stored Queries (Band Trend / Band Flows / Score Movers) to PostgreSQL, closing the parity gap documented in the PG baseline.

These queries' bodies were T-SQL and were deliberately excluded from the PG baseline (`B202607171700`), so a Postgres install had broken Overview analytics while everything else worked. New incremental migration `migrations-pg/V202607201200__v0.3.x_Overview_Queries.pg.sql` seeds all three (Query + parameters + fields + query-entities) with PostgreSQL-dialect SQL and the PostgreSQL `SQLDialectID`. Idempotent (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`). SQL Server is unchanged.
