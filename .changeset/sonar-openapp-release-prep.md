Open App release readiness: make Sonar cleanly installable via `mj app install`.

- **Seed migration.** `mj app install` runs migrations only (it does not process `metadata/`), so a clean install previously got the schema but no app-level config. Added `V202607142340__v0.1.x_Seed_App_Metadata.sql` seeding all 182 app-metadata records (score band sets/bands, time windows, 23 actions + params + result codes, 3 queries, 1 remote operation, and the Sonar Authoring Agent). Verified end-to-end on a fresh core.
- **Portable AI model.** The authoring agent ships without a pinned model (`RequireSpecificModels=0`), so it runs on whatever AI model the host has configured instead of a hardcoded vendor.
- **Caret peer ranges.** MJ peer dependencies moved from exact `5.45.0` to `^5.45.0` across all packages, so the app installs against any compatible `5.45.x`+ host without forcing a duplicate MJ install.
- **Honest version range.** `mjVersionRange` corrected to `>=5.45.0 <6.0.0`, the version Sonar was actually built and verified against.
