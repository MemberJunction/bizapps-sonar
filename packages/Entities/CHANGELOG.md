# @mj-biz-apps/sonar-entities

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- b0ec9d3: Sonar Authoring Agent reliability: validate authored factors (data source + aggregate field), clearer compiler error, higher iteration limits.

  - **Factor authoring is validated against the real schema.** `Sonar: Build Model` and `Sonar: Create Factor` created declarative factors even when (1) no data source was resolved — yielding orphaned factors (`SourceRelatedEntityID = NULL`) — or (2) a column-referencing field (`aggregateFieldName` or `dateField`) wasn't a real column on the source entity (weak models hallucinate names like `TotalAmount` for a `TotalGross` column, or `duration_days` for a column that doesn't exist). Both cases only surfaced at compile/recompute time. Both actions now reject them up front with actionable errors (valid source aliases / valid columns), so the agent self-corrects in-run instead of shipping an uncompilable model. (FilterExpression is free-form SQL — left to the engine, not column-parsed.)
  - **Prompt hint.** The agent's system prompt now tells it to take the exact `aggregateFieldName`/`dateField` from the columns `Sonar: List Related Entities` returns, never invent one — so it leans on the new column data deliberately. Delivered as a forward migration (SQL Server + PG) patching the seeded `TemplateContent`; the frozen seed is untouched.
  - **Column visibility for the agent.** `Sonar: List Related Entities` now returns each candidate source's `columns` (name + type + a `numeric` flag), so the agent picks a real `aggregateFieldName` from the list instead of guessing one — attacking the hallucination at the source (proactive), where the validation above is the reactive backstop.
  - **Clearer FactorCompiler error.** A model-owned factor with no source now reports "no data source — link it to a model related entity," instead of the misleading "library factors not supported yet" (which properly refers only to shared `ScoreModelID = NULL` factors).
  - **A bound, code-approved signal no longer blocks publishing.** `Sonar: Bind Signal To Model` only proceeds when the signal's code is Approved (or it's a trusted codebase action), but it created the ActionBacked factor at `PromotionState='Draft'` — and the model publishability gate rejects any un-Approved action factor. So a signal you fully approved in the Studio still couldn't be published, with a confusing block. The bound factor is now born `PromotionState='Approved'`, since the code approval it already required IS the factor's promotion gate.
  - **Signal Studio signals are now bound to an anchor.** Custom (code-backed) signals were commissioned with only a text description — ActionSmith never knew which entity `AnchorRecordID` belonged to, so it guessed and authored code that `Load`ed the wrong entity by the wrong key (e.g. loading Member Profiles by a Person id → null for every record). The commission form now requires picking the anchor the signal scores, and the kickoff hands ActionSmith that anchor's schema (the anchor entity, its related sources, and each one's link field + columns) as Context. The factor brief spells out the contract: `AnchorRecordID` is the anchor entity's primary key; start from the anchor and reach related data by following its foreign keys, never by loading another entity by `AnchorRecordID`.
  - **Higher agent run limits (12/18 → 36/64).** Real, MoreCheese-scale authoring legitimately exceeds 12 Loop iterations; runs were aborting at the cap mid-authoring (verified in AIAgentRun logs). Delivered as forward migrations (SQL Server + PG); the seed stays frozen.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 744778a: Move the Sonar Authoring Agent tool-surface seed (AIAgentAction links) out of the released seed migration and into a new forward migration, to fix the v0.2.0 -> v0.3.0 upgrade path.

  The agent-tools fix (#24) and its ordering fix (#27) had edited `V202607142340__…_Seed_App_Metadata.sql`, which shipped in v0.2.0. Editing an applied migration changes its Flyway checksum: a fresh install works, but a v0.2.0 -> v0.3.0 upgrade fails validation (checksum mismatch) — and even relaxed, Flyway never re-runs an applied version, so the links would never reach the upgraded install. The seed is now restored byte-for-byte to its v0.2.0 content, and the idempotent AIAgentAction block lives in `V202607202300__v0.3.x_Agent_Tool_Surface.sql`. Running after the seed, the Actions it FK-references already exist (no ordering hazard), and `WHERE NOT EXISTS` makes it safe for fresh installs, upgrades, and re-runs. The seed-lint now checks links across all migrations in execution order.

- 2ca57ac: Wire the Sonar Authoring Agent to its action tool surface so fresh `mj app install` seeds a working agent.

  The agent shipped with zero `AIAgentAction` links, so the Loop runtime built an empty toolbox and every action call (e.g. `Sonar: Find Models`) reported "unavailable". Root cause: `metadata/agents/.mj-sync.json` allow-listed only `MJ: AI Agent Prompts` under `pull.relatedEntities`, so mj-sync silently dropped the agent's action links; the empty snapshot generated an empty seed, and `mj app install` (migrations only, never `metadata/`) shipped the gap to every installer.

  - **`.mj-sync.json`:** add `MJ: AI Agent Actions` to the capture allowlist (root cause fix).
  - **`.sonar-agent.json`:** restore the 22 action links (all Sonar tools except `Run Authoring Agent`) to the agent snapshot.
  - **Seed migration:** idempotent `INSERT ... WHERE NOT EXISTS` so fresh installs seed the agent's tools.

- a38ee7c: PostgreSQL parity for the Sonar Authoring Agent tool surface.

  The PG baseline seeds the agent and all 23 actions but zero AIAgentAction links, so a Postgres install got a toolless agent — the same bug #24 fixed for SQL Server, on the other platform. Adds `migrations-pg/V202607202301__v0.3.x_Agent_Tool_Surface.pg.sql` with the 22 links (agent + action IDs are seed-hardcoded, identical across dialects; idempotent WHERE NOT EXISTS; runs after the baseline so the FK-referenced actions exist). The seed-lint now validates BOTH migrations/ (SQL Server) and migrations-pg/ (PostgreSQL). Verified end-to-end on a fresh MJ-core-on-Postgres-17: full baseline + queries + agent-tools applied clean, agent has 22 tools, 0 orphan FK links.

- 7c38f38: Bring the 3 Overview stored Queries (Band Trend / Band Flows / Score Movers) to PostgreSQL, closing the parity gap documented in the PG baseline.

  These queries' bodies were T-SQL and were deliberately excluded from the PG baseline (`B202607171700`), so a Postgres install had broken Overview analytics while everything else worked. New incremental migration `migrations-pg/V202607201200__v0.3.x_Overview_Queries.pg.sql` seeds all three (Query + parameters + fields + query-entities) with PostgreSQL-dialect SQL and the PostgreSQL `SQLDialectID`. Idempotent (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`). SQL Server is unchanged.

  Entity foreign keys (`QueryEntity.EntityID`, `QueryField.SourceEntityID`) are resolved by entity **Name** via subquery, not hardcoded id — the Sonar entity IDs differ between the SQL Server seed and the PG baseline (CodeGen minted fresh ids on PG), so a literal id would FK-violate on a PG install. Names are stable across both.

- e0894b0: Fix a fresh-install failure introduced by the agent tool-surface seed (#24): the `AIAgentAction` insert block was placed right after the agent/prompt seeding, but the `Sonar:` Action rows it references (via the enforced `ActionID` foreign key) aren't created until later in the same migration. On an already-populated dev DB the actions existed so it passed, but on a clean `mj app install` the block ran first and hit a FK violation, aborting the whole seed.

  Moved the block to the end of the seed migration (after all agents and actions are created) with a placement-guard comment. Verified: a from-scratch FK-ordering repro fails in the old order and succeeds in the new order.

- 8c46c2b: Add PostgreSQL install support, following the bizapps family convention (bizapps-common, issues, tasks, forms all ship `migrations-pg/`).

  - **`migrations-pg/B202607142340...` one-shot baseline** (`B…__Schema_and_Tables.pg.sql`): the full `__mj_BizAppsSonar` schema + CRUD functions + views + triggers + entity registration + app-level seed (score bands, time windows, 23 actions, remote op, authoring agent), extracted from a post-codegen + post-seed PostgreSQL database (CodeGen's fixed point). Installs one-shot via `mj migrate` alone — verified on a fresh PG core (14 tables, 42 functions, 14 views, 14 registered entities, full seed) with no `mj codegen` step.
  - **`mj:migrate:convert` / `mj:migrate:pg`** scripts wired into package.json.
  - **Known gap:** the 3 Sonar Overview stored Queries are T-SQL and are not yet ported to PostgreSQL (documented in the baseline header); PG rewrites are a follow-up.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 86a6697: Initial `__mj_BizAppsSonar` schema (plan §5.1–§5.4): 14 tables across configuration (ScoreModel, ScoreModelVersion, ModelRelatedEntity, ScoreBandSet, ScoreBand), factors & windows (Factor, TimeWindow, ModelFactor), runtime output (Score, ScoreFactorContribution, ScoreHistory, ScoreBandTransition), and recompute/audit (ScoreRecomputeRun, ScoreModelAuditEvent) — with generated entity classes, GraphQL resolvers, and Angular forms. Includes the schema-creation guard, composite/non-FK indexes, and folded CodeGen SQL. Also bumps the MemberJunction framework to 5.40.2.
- b3ed75b: Open App release readiness: make Sonar cleanly installable via `mj app install`.

  - **Seed migration.** `mj app install` runs migrations only (it does not process `metadata/`), so a clean install previously got the schema but no app-level config. Added `V202607142340__v0.1.x_Seed_App_Metadata.sql` seeding all 182 app-metadata records (score band sets/bands, time windows, 23 actions + params + result codes, 3 queries, 1 remote operation, and the Sonar Authoring Agent). Verified end-to-end on a fresh core.
  - **Portable AI model.** The authoring agent ships without a pinned model (`RequireSpecificModels=0`), so it runs on whatever AI model the host has configured instead of a hardcoded vendor.
  - **Caret peer ranges.** MJ peer dependencies moved from exact `5.45.0` to `^5.45.0` across all packages, so the app installs against any compatible `5.45.x`+ host without forcing a duplicate MJ install.
  - **Honest version range.** `mjVersionRange` corrected to `>=5.45.0 <6.0.0`, the version Sonar was actually built and verified against.

- d13067b: Engine v1 feature layer + `Factor.DateField` schema.

  Adds the engine capabilities the Sonar app needs on top of the action-factor engine, plus the one v1 schema change:

  - **Composite / entity-agnostic anchor keys** — `anchorKey.ts` builds identity on MJ's `CompositeKey` (collision-safe canonical string + type-faithful JSON + per-column values for OPENJSON), so single- AND multi-column-PK anchors both score end-to-end. `resolvePopulation` drops the single-column guard; the set-based factor query stages the population via a temp table instead of an inline `IN (…)` list (kills the ~2100-value ceiling + the string-interpolation workaround); `ScoreWriter` persists `AnchorRecordKeyJSON`.
  - **`Factor.DateField`** — new nullable column (migration `V202606241200`) naming the related-entity activity-date column a windowed factor filters on. Frees `TimeWindow.AnchorDateField` to mean only the anchor boundary date; wires `SinceEvent`/`RenewalRelative` windows.
  - **Action-output clamping** (`clampToRange`) — an action factor's value is clamped to its declared output range, flagging contract drift.
  - **Explainability threading** — a factor's "why" rides `FactorResult.explanation` → contribution → persisted `ScoreFactorContribution.DetailJSON`.
  - **Score trend + history persistence** — every recompute writes an immutable `ScoreHistory` snapshot and, when an anchor's band changes, a `ScoreBandTransition` row; the current `Score` also carries `Delta` / `TrendDirection` / `DataCompleteness` vs. the trend-window baseline. This is what backs the Overview trend, per-anchor sparklines, and the "movers" feed. The trend math (delta, direction deadband, baseline reduction, band-change detection) lives in a pure, unit-tested `scoreTrend` module — `ScoreWriter` just does the entity plumbing.

  Generated entities/resolvers/forms + the GraphQL schema are regenerated for the DateField column (clean — no intervention/demo entities). The CodeGen SQL (regenerated `vwFactors` view, Factor CRUD procs, FK indexes, and the DateField EntityField metadata) is appended into the migration file per convention. Verified end-to-end: Initial + DateField migrations apply cleanly on a fresh clean-MJ database.

### Patch Changes

- 069db79: Upgrade all `@memberjunction/*` dependencies to exact `5.45.0` (latest), moving Sonar onto the current MemberJunction platform.

  **Requires the database core to be at MJ 5.45.** Packages and the `__mj` core schema must match — the server generates its GraphQL from DB metadata and the AI engine reads agent config from core tables. Bring a database up with:

  ```
  mj migrate --tag v5.45.0        # __mj core -> 5.45 (Skyway baseline + delta)
  mj migrate --schema __mj_BizAppsSonar --dir ./migrations   # Sonar app schema
  mj codegen                      # register entities, build views/sprocs
  ```

  Notes:

  - **Exact pins, not caret** — MJ publishes exact sibling versions, so a single `^` cascades the whole tree (and creates nested dual-core copies). Every `@memberjunction/*` is `"5.45.0"`.
  - Verified end-to-end against a freshly-provisioned 5.45 database (clean boot with no metadata skew, all surfaces render, copilot agent runs and replies).
  - Supersedes the interim 5.41.0 alignment (which matched an older demo DB). 5.45 is the current platform; the DB is migrated forward to match rather than pinning packages back.
