# @mj-biz-apps/sonar-entities

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 86a6697: Initial `__mj_BizAppsSonar` schema (plan §5.1–§5.4): 14 tables across configuration (ScoreModel, ScoreModelVersion, ModelRelatedEntity, ScoreBandSet, ScoreBand), factors & windows (Factor, TimeWindow, ModelFactor), runtime output (Score, ScoreFactorContribution, ScoreHistory, ScoreBandTransition), and recompute/audit (ScoreRecomputeRun, ScoreModelAuditEvent) — with generated entity classes, GraphQL resolvers, and Angular forms. Includes the schema-creation guard, composite/non-FK indexes, and folded CodeGen SQL. Also bumps the MemberJunction framework to 5.40.2.
- b3ed75b: Open App release readiness: make Sonar cleanly installable via `mj app install`.

  - **Seed migration.** `mj app install` runs migrations only (it does not process `metadata/`), so a clean install previously got the schema but no app-level config. Added `V202607142340__v0.1.x_Seed_App_Metadata.sql` seeding all 182 app-metadata records (score band sets/bands, time windows, 23 actions + params + result codes, 3 queries, 1 remote operation, and the Sonar Authoring Agent). Verified end-to-end on a fresh core.
  - **Portable AI model.** The authoring agent ships without a pinned model (`RequireSpecificModels=0`), so it runs on whatever AI model the host has configured instead of a hardcoded vendor.
  - **Caret peer ranges.** MJ peer dependencies moved from exact `5.45.0` to `^5.45.0` across all packages, so the app installs against any compatible `5.45.x`+ host without forcing a duplicate MJ install.
  - **Honest version range.** `mjVersionRange` corrected to `>=5.45.0 <6.0.0`, the version Sonar was actually built and verified against.

- d13067b: Engine v1 feature layer + `Factor.DateField` schema.

  Adds the engine capabilities the Sonar app needs on top of the action-factor engine, plus the one v1 schema change:

  - **Composite / entity-agnostic anchor keys** — `anchorKey.ts` builds identity on MJ's `CompositeKey` (collision-safe canonical string + type-faithful JSON + per-column values for OPENJSON), so single- AND multi-column-PK anchors both score end-to-end. `resolvePopulation` drops the single-column guard; the set-based factor query stages the population via a temp table instead of an inline `IN (…)` list (kills the ~2100-value ceiling + the string-interpolation workaround); `ScoreWriter` persists `AnchorRecordKeyJSON`.
  - **`Factor.DateField`** — new nullable column (migration `V202606241200`) naming the related-entity activity-date column a windowed factor filters on. Frees `TimeWindow.AnchorDateField` to mean only the anchor boundary date; wires `SinceEvent`/`RenewalRelative` windows.
  - **Action-output clamping** (`clampToRange`) — an action factor's value is clamped to its declared output range, flagging contract drift.
  - **Explainability threading** — a factor's "why" rides `FactorResult.explanation` → contribution → persisted `ScoreFactorContribution.DetailJSON`.
  - **Score trend + history persistence** — every recompute writes an immutable `ScoreHistory` snapshot and, when an anchor's band changes, a `ScoreBandTransition` row; the current `Score` also carries `Delta` / `TrendDirection` / `DataCompleteness` vs. the trend-window baseline. This is what backs the Overview trend, per-anchor sparklines, and the "movers" feed. The trend math (delta, direction deadband, baseline reduction, band-change detection) lives in a pure, unit-tested `scoreTrend` module — `ScoreWriter` just does the entity plumbing.

  Generated entities/resolvers/forms + the GraphQL schema are regenerated for the DateField column (clean — no intervention/demo entities). The CodeGen SQL (regenerated `vwFactors` view, Factor CRUD procs, FK indexes, and the DateField EntityField metadata) is appended into the migration file per convention. Verified end-to-end: Initial + DateField migrations apply cleanly on a fresh clean-MJ database.

### Patch Changes

- 069db79: Upgrade all `@memberjunction/*` dependencies to exact `5.45.0` (latest), moving Sonar onto the current MemberJunction platform.

  **Requires the database core to be at MJ 5.45.** Packages and the `__mj` core schema must match — the server generates its GraphQL from DB metadata and the AI engine reads agent config from core tables. Bring a database up with:

  ```
  mj migrate --tag v5.45.0        # __mj core -> 5.45 (Skyway baseline + delta)
  mj migrate --schema __mj_BizAppsSonar --dir ./migrations   # Sonar app schema
  mj codegen                      # register entities, build views/sprocs
  ```

  Notes:

  - **Exact pins, not caret** — MJ publishes exact sibling versions, so a single `^` cascades the whole tree (and creates nested dual-core copies). Every `@memberjunction/*` is `"5.45.0"`.
  - Verified end-to-end against a freshly-provisioned 5.45 database (clean boot with no metadata skew, all surfaces render, copilot agent runs and replies).
  - Supersedes the interim 5.41.0 alignment (which matched an older demo DB). 5.45 is the current platform; the DB is migrated forward to match rather than pinning packages back.
