## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b3ed75b: Open App release readiness: make Sonar cleanly installable via `mj app install`.

  - **Seed migration.** `mj app install` runs migrations only (it does not process `metadata/`), so a clean install previously got the schema but no app-level config. Added `V202607142340__v0.1.x_Seed_App_Metadata.sql` seeding all 182 app-metadata records (score band sets/bands, time windows, 23 actions + params + result codes, 3 queries, 1 remote operation, and the Sonar Authoring Agent). Verified end-to-end on a fresh core.
  - **Portable AI model.** The authoring agent ships without a pinned model (`RequireSpecificModels=0`), so it runs on whatever AI model the host has configured instead of a hardcoded vendor.
  - **Caret peer ranges.** MJ peer dependencies moved from exact `5.45.0` to `^5.45.0` across all packages, so the app installs against any compatible `5.45.x`+ host without forcing a duplicate MJ install.
  - **Honest version range.** `mjVersionRange` corrected to `>=5.45.0 <6.0.0`, the version Sonar was actually built and verified against.

- 2decde6: Sonar Actions layer — the agent-callable / UI-callable server seam.

  Adds the hand-authored Sonar actions (`packages/Actions/src/custom`) + their metadata (`.sonar-actions.json`) and the Server bootstrap that registers them and loads the action-runtime-host:

  - **Engine wrappers:** Preview Model, Recompute Model, Validate Factor, Create Factor, Create Model, Add Data Source, Set Band Set, Describe Model, Build Model, List Related Entities.
  - **Agentic authoring surface:** Author Factor, Run Authoring Agent, Start Factor Job, Refine Factor Action, Cancel Factor Job, Test Signal, Bind Signal To Model, Find Entities, Find Models, List Factor Actions, Unpublish Model, Get Prompt, Update Prompt.

  `SonarActionBase` (shared helpers) and `SonarFactorAction` (the factor-action base + contract registry, consumed by List Factor Actions) ship as the substrate. The two _example_ hand-authored factor-actions (Member Activity Streak, Resource Review Sentiment) are intentionally excluded from v1 — factor-actions are authored via Codesmith (Runtime) in the Signal Studio.

- d13067b: Engine v1 feature layer + `Factor.DateField` schema.

  Adds the engine capabilities the Sonar app needs on top of the action-factor engine, plus the one v1 schema change:

  - **Composite / entity-agnostic anchor keys** — `anchorKey.ts` builds identity on MJ's `CompositeKey` (collision-safe canonical string + type-faithful JSON + per-column values for OPENJSON), so single- AND multi-column-PK anchors both score end-to-end. `resolvePopulation` drops the single-column guard; the set-based factor query stages the population via a temp table instead of an inline `IN (…)` list (kills the ~2100-value ceiling + the string-interpolation workaround); `ScoreWriter` persists `AnchorRecordKeyJSON`.
  - **`Factor.DateField`** — new nullable column (migration `V202606241200`) naming the related-entity activity-date column a windowed factor filters on. Frees `TimeWindow.AnchorDateField` to mean only the anchor boundary date; wires `SinceEvent`/`RenewalRelative` windows.
  - **Action-output clamping** (`clampToRange`) — an action factor's value is clamped to its declared output range, flagging contract drift.
  - **Explainability threading** — a factor's "why" rides `FactorResult.explanation` → contribution → persisted `ScoreFactorContribution.DetailJSON`.
  - **Score trend + history persistence** — every recompute writes an immutable `ScoreHistory` snapshot and, when an anchor's band changes, a `ScoreBandTransition` row; the current `Score` also carries `Delta` / `TrendDirection` / `DataCompleteness` vs. the trend-window baseline. This is what backs the Overview trend, per-anchor sparklines, and the "movers" feed. The trend math (delta, direction deadband, baseline reduction, band-change detection) lives in a pure, unit-tested `scoreTrend` module — `ScoreWriter` just does the entity plumbing.

  Generated entities/resolvers/forms + the GraphQL schema are regenerated for the DateField column (clean — no intervention/demo entities). The CodeGen SQL (regenerated `vwFactors` view, Factor CRUD procs, FK indexes, and the DateField EntityField metadata) is appended into the migration file per convention. Verified end-to-end: Initial + DateField migrations apply cleanly on a fresh clean-MJ database.

### Patch Changes

- 069db79: Upgrade all `@memberjunction/*` dependencies to exact `5.45.0` (latest), moving Sonar onto the current MemberJunction platform.

  **Requires the database core to be at MJ 5.45.** Packages and the `__mj` core schema must match — the server generates its GraphQL from DB metadata and the AI engine reads agent config from core tables. Bring a database up with:

  ```
  mj migrate --tag v5.45.0        # __mj core -> 5.45 (Skyway baseline + delta)
  mj migrate --schema __mj_BizAppsSonar --dir ./migrations   # Sonar app schema
  mj codegen                      # register entities, build views/sprocs
  ```

  Notes:

  - **Exact pins, not caret** — MJ publishes exact sibling versions, so a single `^` cascades the whole tree (and creates nested dual-core copies). Every `@memberjunction/*` is `"5.45.0"`.
  - Verified end-to-end against a freshly-provisioned 5.45 database (clean boot with no metadata skew, all surfaces render, copilot agent runs and replies).
  - Supersedes the interim 5.41.0 alignment (which matched an older demo DB). 5.45 is the current platform; the DB is migrated forward to match rather than pinning packages back.
